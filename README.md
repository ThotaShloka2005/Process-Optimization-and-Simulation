# 📈 Paper Manufacturing Process Optimization & Simulation

## 🗓️ Day 20: Process Optimization & Simulation

This project demonstrates the use of **Python-based optimization** and **simulation techniques** to improve a paper manufacturing process. The focus is on analyzing process parameters such as temperature, pressure, and speed to optimize for **quality**, **cost**, and **throughput**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Apply optimization techniques using Python (`scipy.optimize`)
- Build a simulation model for paper production
- Run what-if scenario analysis using parametric sensitivity
- Identify optimal process parameters and forecast improvements

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains synthetic or collected CSV files with the following:

- `temperature` (°C)
- `pressure` (bar)
- `speed` (m/min)
- Resulting metrics: `quality`, `cost`, `throughput`

> Replace with your actual dataset or use parameter ranges as defined in code.
